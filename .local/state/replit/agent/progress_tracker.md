## Technical Details

### Database Schema Understanding
- `examResults` table: Stores general exam information (exam_name, exam_date, exam_type, exam_scope)
- `examSubjectNets` table: Stores detailed subject-wise scores (correct_count, wrong_count, blank_count, net_score, wrong_topics_json)
- Email template must use `examSubjectNets` for detailed d/y/b/net display

### Data Flow
1. Backend fetches data from both `examResults` and `examSubjectNets` tables
2. Email template processes examSubjectNets to extract:
   - Subject-wise scores (doğru, yanlış, boş, net)
   - Wrong topics from JSON field
3. Template displays data in beautiful gradient-styled cards
